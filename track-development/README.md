# Track Development 
**Meta-track: Building a Track**

In this track, you’ll design and build a complete LEVEL3 track, based on something that actually matters. The goal is to turn a real-world challenge into a structured 4-week challenge that helps others learn something useful, relevant, and impressive.

You’ll go through the full process:  
- Choosing the topic  
- Structuring the 4-week progression  
- Collecting helpful resources and hints  
- Building a working solution to test and validate the track  

This "Track Development Project" project will also act as a **template for what a good LEVEL3 track should look like**.

> ⚠️ **Don’t work in isolation.** Each phase should be reviewed with us to make sure you’re on track and aligned with the goals of the program.

## Submission Format  
- Submit your track as a **Markdown document**.

## 1. Define the Topic

Start by identifying a topic that reflects a **real problem or process**. Something people genuinely care about and that shows up in daily engineering or product work.

Your topic should be:  
- **Job-relevant** (it reflects real-world scenarios)  
- **Teachable in 4 weeks**  
- **Impressive** (you’d be impressed if someone brought it up in an interview)


Then, write a short introduction that answers:  
- What will the participant have built or accomplished by the end of the 4 weeks?  
- Why is this useful or relevant in a real job context?

## 2. Structure the Track

Break the project into **four incremental parts**, each representing one week of work. Each week should:  
- Build on the previous one  
- Have a clear, achievable goal  
- Lead toward a final, working deliverable in Week 4

> 💡 Tip: Keep the scope realistic. If Week 1 takes 3 days in the real world, that’s fine — not everything needs to be perfectly even.



## 3. Add Hints and Constraints

Include helpful resources and constraints for participants:  
- **Links** to articles, repos, docs, or internal tools  
- **Hints** about pitfalls to avoid  
- **Restrictions**: required tools, libraries, languages, frameworks, etc.

> ⚠️ You don't need to explain the theory. The goal is to **save time and reduce frustration**, not write a textbook.


## 4. Build Your Own Solution

You must build the full project yourself to ensure:  
1. It's feasible in practice  
2. You catch tricky or ambiguous areas  
3. You can provide a working reference if questions come up later

Your solution doesn’t have to be pretty or production-grade, but it should:  
- Cover all 4 weeks  
- Meet your own stated requirements  
- Be shared in a **private repo** with us

> ⚠️ Your solution is **not the final product** — it’s a safety net.
