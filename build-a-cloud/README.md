# Build a Cloud

You build a flexible and secure cloud platform using OpenStack for infrastructure and Kubernetes to run and manage applications. You use Zitadel for user authentication and access control. The platform includes a managed service layer with metering, autoscaling, and multi-region support. A Vue.js web interface and a Golang SDK let users and developers interact with the system easily. You automate everything with Terraform, and use Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for monitoring, logging, and performance visibility.
