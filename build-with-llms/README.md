# Build with LLMs

You design and build an AI agent product from scratch, starting with your own problem statement and use case. You implement the solution using LangChain for agent orchestration and LangGraph for managing complex multi-step workflows. Your system integrates tools, memory, and external APIs to enable dynamic decision-making. You develop a full working prototype, refine the user experience, and prepare a final demo that clearly communicates the productâ€™s value and potential.
